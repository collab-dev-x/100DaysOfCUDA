# Tensor Cores vs. CUDA Cores

## Overview
Tensor Cores, introduced with NVIDIA's Volta architecture, are specialized hardware in NVIDIA GPUs (Volta, Turing, Ampere, Hopper, Blackwell) designed for accelerating matrix operations, particularly for deep learning. CUDA Cores, in contrast, are general-purpose units for parallel computing tasks.

## Tensor Cores: Key Benefits
Tensor Cores excel in matrix-heavy, compute-bound workloads, offering:
- **High Throughput**: Perform 4x4 or larger matrix multiplications in a single clock cycle, significantly faster than CUDA Cores.
- **Mixed Precision**: Use lower-precision formats (FP16, INT8, BF16, TF32) for multiplication and higher-precision (FP32) for accumulation, balancing speed and accuracy.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Optimized for low-latency data movement within the GPU, ideal for repeated matrix operations.

## Using Tensor Cores in CUDA C++
To leverage Tensor Cores:
1. **WMMA API**: Use NVIDIA’s Warp Matrix Multiply Accumulate (WMMA) API for direct Tensor Core programming:
   - **Fragments**: Store matrices A, B, and C in fragment data structures, managed by warp threads.
   - **Matrix Sizes**: Default to 16x16x16 tiles for efficient operation.
   - **Data Types**: Support FP16, BF16, TF32, or INT8 for multiplication, with FP32 accumulation.
2. **Libraries**: Use optimized libraries like cuBLAS, cuDNN, or CUTLASS for large matrix operations and convolutions.
3. **Mixed Precision**: Use FP16/TF32 inputs with `cuda::half` or `cublasGemmEx`. Enable Tensor Core acceleration with:
   - `cudnnSetConvolutionMathType(..., CUDNN_TENSOR_OP_MATH)` for cuDNN.
   - `cublasSetMathMode(..., CUBLAS_TENSOR_OP_MATH)` for cuBLAS.
4. **Custom Kernels**: Write CUDA kernels using the WMMA API for fine-grained control.

## When to Use CUDA Cores
CUDA Cores are better suited for:
1. **High-Precision Workloads**: Support FP32/FP64 natively, ideal for scientific computing requiring full precision.
2. **General-Purpose Tasks**: Handle non-matrix operations (e.g., sorting, logic, branching) where Tensor Cores offer no benefit.
3. **Memory-Bound Kernels**: Provide better performance for tasks limited by memory bandwidth (e.g., sparse matrices, stencils).
4. **Small or Irregular Matrices**: More efficient for small or misaligned matrix sizes, as Tensor Cores require large, aligned data.
5. **Legacy Code**: Compatible with older frameworks or code not optimized for Tensor Cores.
6. **Strict Accuracy Needs**: Avoid potential rounding errors from Tensor Cores’ lower-precision formats.


## Conclusion
Tensor Cores are ideal for large, dense, matrix-heavy, compute-bound deep learning workloads with mixed precision. CUDA Cores are more versatile for high-precision, general-purpose, memory-bound, or legacy tasks.
